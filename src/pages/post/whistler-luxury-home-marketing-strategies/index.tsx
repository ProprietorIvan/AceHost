              </h2>

              <p>
                Influencer and Celebrity marketing is not the main method of
                exposure for bookings, it is an optional added bonus when
                working with us. While it is understandable that not all
                homeowners wish to have their properties featured on social
                media, those who have chosen to do so have experienced
                remarkable benefits. Through influencer collaborations, AceHost
                has created heightened visibility and exposure for these
                properties, resulting in increased bookings and rental demand.
                This mutually beneficial approach allows AceHost to promote our
                listings while also providing indirect benefits to our
                homeowners.
